      For 100 years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has helped to keep U.S. 
      technology at the leading edge. Over the years, NIST has made solid contributions to image 
      processing, DNA diagnostic "chips," smoke detectors, and automated error-correcting software 
      for machine tools. NIST also has had major impact on atomic clocks, X-ray standards for mammography, 
      scanning tunneling microscopy, pollution-control technology, and high-speed dental drills.

      Founded on March 3, 1901, as the National Bureau of Standards, NIST was one of the first 
      federal research laboratories. NIST's major accomplishments of the past 100 years and their 
      impact on industry, science and technology, the nation's economy, and the public are described
       in: <a href="https://www.nist.gov/history/nist-100-foundations-progress">NIST at 100: Foundations for Progress</a>.

      Fast forwarding to 2020: few members of the New Leader Program (NLP), class #18, decided to 
      implement an escape room game highlighting NIST research topics. 
      Please see below the full list of contributors to this project.
    </p>
    
    <p>As COVID-19 pandemic affected our lives and our work, the team members decided to take few 
      of the research topics that could be converted into digital stories and create a virtual 
      excape room game.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The NLP Virtual Escape Room brings the player to the year 2051 when the NIST Time Capsule needs 
    to be opened. The player is asked to recover in time for the grand opening (in only 60 minutes) 
    the Time Capsule's keycode. To do so, the player must resolve a chain of riddles that are 
    derived frorm selected NIST research projects.
