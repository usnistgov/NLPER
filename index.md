# NLP18: NIST Virtual Escape Room

<p>
  For 100 years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has helped to keep U.S. technology at the leading edge. Over the years, NIST has made solid contributions to image processing, DNA diagnostic "chips," smoke detectors, and automated error-correcting software for machine tools. NIST also has had major impact on atomic clocks, X-ray standards for mammography, scanning tunneling microscopy, pollution-control technology, and high-speed dental drills.

<p>
Founded on March 3, 1901, as the National Bureau of Standards, NIST was one of the first federal research laboratories. NIST's major accomplishments of the past 100 years and their impact on industry, science and technology, the nation's economy, and the public are described in

<p>
Fast forwarding to 2020: few members of the New Leader Program (NLP), class #18, decided to implement an escape room game highlighting NIST research topics. As COVID-19 pandemic affected our lives and work, the team members decided to take few of the research topics that could be converted into digital stories and create a virtual excape room game.
